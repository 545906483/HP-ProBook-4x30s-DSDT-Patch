# Please Note:
#
# These patches were created just to test out some functionality in my version of VoodooPS2Keyboard.
# They add the necessary methods to allow the keyboard backlight control methods to be accessed
# from the keyboard driver.
#
# These methods inside the PS2K device simply forward their requests on to methods elsewhere
# in the DSDT to manipulate the keyboard backlight.
# 
# The methods here are implemented for an ASUS G73JH.
