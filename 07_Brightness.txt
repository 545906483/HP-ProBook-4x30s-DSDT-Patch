# Please Note:
#
# These patches were created just to test out some functionality in my version of VoodooPS2Keyboard.
# They add the necessary methods to allow the screen brightness control methods to be accessed
# from the keyboard driver.
#
# These methods inside the PS2K device simply forward their requests on to the standard
# ACPI brightness methods in the IGPU device.
# 
# This was implemented to see if the methods would work with the Probook as the native screen
# brightness functionality is not 100%. Unfortunately, they didn't work at all.
